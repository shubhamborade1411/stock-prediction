# stock-prediction
This is stock price prediction model based on stacked LSTM. 
I have acquired data from Tiingo api which provide us real time data through api service. As it is real time data, so there are almost no missing values and 
any other data mismatch. The model I used to make prediction is stacked LSTM which stands for Long Short term memory.
